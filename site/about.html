        <p>Can't I Have Some Privacy is a final project for COMP 426 created by James Allen and James Martin.</p>
        <p>Our goal was to create a mobile-friendly Yelp!-styled guide to bathrooms on UNC's campus!</p>
        <p>Reviews are crowdsourced, bathrooms currently are not. If you would like to submit a bathroom, please send us mail via the address in the footer!</p>
