Can't I Have Some Privacy?
======================
Also known as *CIHSP*. 

## What is CIHSP?

CIHSP was a humorous final project, written by [me](http://github.com/jlmartin9) and my good friend [James Allen](http://github.com/jjallen37) for our final project in Advanced Web Development. We had to write a web application using HTML5, JavaScript, PHP, and a MySQL database. It is a good demonstration of our knowledge of how to write such applications, so I want to keep the code hosted for demonstration.

We also made use of JQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.

The application is a proof of concept of a crowdsourced review guide for the bathrooms around UNC-Chapel Hill's campus. The website is built to be responsive, so you can post reviews from your phone or tablet. 

## The website

Located [here](http://cihsp.github.io). I'm still working out the kinks of hosting on github.io, but you can see the source [here](http://github.com/cihsp/cihsp.github.io).

The CS department website required a log in and the URL was much too long.
