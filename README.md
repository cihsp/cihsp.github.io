Can't I Have Some Privacy?
======================
Also known as *CIHSP*.

  <dt>What is CIHSP?</dt>
  <dd>CIHSP is a crowd-sourced bathroom review guide for UNC Chapel Hill's campus.>
  <dt>Why was CISHP developed? Don't other websites like this exist already?</dt>
  <dd>CISHP is a proof-of-concept website developed by James Allen and James Martin for their final project of Advanced Web Programming (COMP 426), at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
    While we're not entirely thrilled that we both finished with an A-, we are proud of the product that came together at the end. We're also stoked about getting some hands-on experience with RESTful interfaces, JQuery, Bootstrap elements, PHP controllers, and practical SQL usage. We were both in the Files and Databases course in the same semester, and we were excited to implement a back end of BCNF relations in SQL.
    Also, to answer the second question, we *thought* we were the first...</dd>

The Website Itself
------------

*Can I visit the website?*

You certainly may, as it is hosted on the UNC CS department's webspace. The URL is quite long, but is located [here](http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp426-f13/jamesml/site/index.html).

You can even submit reviews for our non-existent bathrooms! Maybe we'll get around to entering real bathrooms... eventually...
