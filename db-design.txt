Going to generate the Bathrooms database ourselves (for now)

Database schemas  

Bathrooms
    bid : INT, primary key (generated by us)
    building : CHAR(25), Building name
    floor : INT
    roomNumber : CHAR(25)
    description : CHAR(255)
    
Reviews
    bid : INT, primary key, foreign key to the Bathroom table
    subject : VARCHAR(25)
    text : VARCHAR(255)
    cleanliness : INT (MAX = 5)
    convenience : INT (MAX = 5)
    congestion : INT (MAX = 5)
    conglomerate : INT (MAX = 5)
    time : TIMESTAMP()

In order to retrieve all Reviews for a Bathroom, we need to query SELECT
